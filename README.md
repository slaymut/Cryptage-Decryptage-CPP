# Cryptage-Decryptage-CPP
This repository is for the C++ project.
This repository is to be compiled with c++ 17 ( -std=c++17 )

Everything we advancement made has to be written in this README.md file for best practice. Commits are nice, but this could be better !

I'm using CLION, tell me if you want me to add the cmake, and its build on github.

# Class Sommet and ArbreB

Started writing both Sommet and ArbreB classes. Added constructors (You can add more if you think necessary) and some fonctions. I'd say Half done. To be continued !!!!

Added Insert method in the ArbreB class. It inserts a node in the tree. More explanation will come soon !

Quick update:
Part 1 is done. Onto part two !
